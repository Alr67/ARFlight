# ARFlight - SkyScanner at HackUPC'17

ARFlight is an ARKit (iOS) and UWP (HoloLens) project that allows the user to check, in an AR Europe's map, the prices to fly from an airport to another one in a very visual way, with animations and intuitive interaction. Furthermore, the two platforms could interact with each other thanks to a custom server we deployed as well, which allowed the users to check the flights together and interact in real time in the same AR map.

The project was developed at the Hackaton called HackUPC in 48h. We used Unity engine, MapBox to render Europe's map and an iPad Pro and a HoloLens as deployment target. Since we joined SkyScanner's content, we also used their API to retrieve all the necessary data, like airport locations and flight prices.
